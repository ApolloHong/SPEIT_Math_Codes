SPEIT Math Codes is a collaborative project aimed at providing a comprehensive collection of mathematical algorithms and code implementations. The repository serves as a resource for students and researchers interested in various mathematical topics such as linear algebra, calculus, optimization, and more.

The codes provided here are developed by SPEIT students and are intended to be used for educational and reference purposes. They are not meant to be production-ready or optimized for performance. However, they can serve as a starting point for further exploration and implementation in real-world scenarios.

## Installation
To use the codes in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

## Copy
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SPEIT_Math_Codes.git
    ```

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. The specific requirements for each code implementation can be found in their respective directories.

## Usage
Each code implementation is organized into its own directory within the repository. To use a specific code, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.

The codes are written in various programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, and C++, depending on the preferences of the contributors. Make sure you have the necessary environment and dependencies set up for the specific language before running the code.

## Contributing
